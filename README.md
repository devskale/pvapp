# Solar Installation Calculator

## Description
This simple web application allows users to estimate the parameters of a solar module installation. It takes the peak kW as input and provides the required square meters, installation cost, number of panels, and projected energy production per year. The application also displays a graph comparing the average daily energy production to the average daily consumption for a single-person household and a family in Central Europe.
